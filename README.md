the best best web app on the internet!

## User Story

```
AS A savy internet user
I WANT to search for content
AND view that content in a modern, aesthetically oriented way
SO THAT I can share interesting content with my friends
```

## Functionality

its works like this

```
GIVEN a search page with form inputs
WHEN I search something
THEN I am presented with a layout of tiles
WHEN I scroll down to view the tiles
THEN the scroll bar crawls to the top of the page
WHEN I click on a tile
THEN the content of that tile is added to my clipboard
```
