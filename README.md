## Screenshots

Below is an example of the results from running the query "tesla.com" with a small list of dorks.

The following command was run to query for "tesla.com" against a list of dorks:

`python3 GitDorker.py -tf TOKENSFILE -q tesla.com -d dorks/DORKFILE -o tesla`

![Results](https://github.com/obheda12/GitDorker/blob/master/GitDorker%20Usage%20Example%20-%20Tesla.png)

Note: The more advanced queries you put (i.e incorporation of user, org, endpoint information, etc. the more succint results you will achieve)

I am more than open to suggestions and criticisms. If you think the tool sucks or if you find issues/bugs please let me know and recommend how I can improve it :)
